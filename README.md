**FLIPKART SENTIMENT ANALYSIS USING PYTHON**
This project analyzes sentiment from Flipkart reviews using Python. The dataset used for this analysis is sourced from Kaggle, containing product reviews from Flipkart customers.

**Overview**
The analysis involves several steps:

1.Data preprocessing to clean the reviews data.
2.Sentiment analysis to classify reviews into Positive, Negative, and Neutral categories.
3.Visualization of review sentiments using plots and word clouds.

**Libraries Used**
pandas for data manipulation and analysis.
seaborn, matplotlib.pyplot for data visualization.
nltk for natural language processing tasks.
wordcloud for generating word clouds.

**Dataset**
The dataset used is available publicly on GitHub: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/amankharwal/Website-data/master/flipkart_reviews.csv

Flipkart Reviews Dataset
**Installation**
Before running the script, make sure you have the required libraries installed:

 #pip install pandas seaborn matplotlib nltk wordcloud plotly
 
**Steps**
**Data Import and Initial Exploration:**

Import the dataset and inspect its structure.
Check for any missing values in the dataset.

**Data Preprocessing:**

Clean the text data by removing noise such as URLs, punctuation, and stopwords.
Perform stemming to reduce words to their root form.

**Sentiment Analysis:**

Utilize the VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner) sentiment analysis tool from nltk to compute sentiment scores (Positive, Negative, Neutral) for each review.

**Visualization:**

Visualize the distribution of ratings using a pie chart.
Create a word cloud to visualize the most frequent words in the reviews.
Conclusion:

Analyze the sentiment scores to draw conclusions about customer sentiment towards Flipkart products and services.
**Usage**
To reproduce the analysis:

Clone the repository or download the script and dataset.
Run the Python script (flipkart_sentiment_analysis.py).
View the generated visualizations and sentiment analysis results.
